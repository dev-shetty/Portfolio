Recently while watching, [@Coding Garden](https://youtu.be/g6_e5Mj7Hzw?si=_dJqGIQVwauM2SVS) I came across sli.dev, which he uses to build slides for his presentations.

From then I wanted to try it, recently I got a chance while preparing for my talk at [Hackersmang](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7400442590375903232/)

## Why I love sli.dev

It always felt like a hassle to create presentations in GUI editors like slides or figma, I had to manually arrange the elements, move my mouse a lot to do something, struggle picking colors from the picker, manually size the images to align it correct (again moving my mouse), add what not.

[Sli.dev](https://sli.dev/guide/) basically solves all of the above problems, and also gives you ability to annotate, record, present, export, have beautiful code transitions, and what not.

And that too with code. Yes, markdown files. I can use tailwind classes to style the elements, while using markdown for the typography, and using HTML tags for features like videos and images.

Because of this you can **self-host** the slides, for eg. I have my slides at [`slides.shetty.me`](https://slides.shetty.me). This is so neat to share the slides with anyone.

As mentioned, this blog will focus mainly on the hosting part, while I might write a detailed post on sli.dev in future when I have some experience creating more slides.

For now you can see the [slides source code](https://gist.github.com/dev-shetty/60c0c39c4229467b820addea52802808), and the [hosted slides](https://slides.shetty.me/chrome-ai-apis/) of my recent talk on Chrome AI APIs.

## Self-hosting your slides

Sli.dev uses `vite` to build your applications, which means it can generate you static files which you can directly throw anywhere without any need to run a node server.

To host those files

1. You need to build the slides which you just wrote
2. Send them over to your VPS or any server,
3. Configure your domain and use nginx as reverse proxy

I am assuming you have nginx setup, if not you can [read this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04)

## Generating the slides static files

It's quite simple, to generate static files for sli.dev

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`npx slidev build`} />

If you want to host the slides in a page inside your domain, then

<CodeBlock language="bash" code={`npx slidev build --base /<path-slug>`} />

`path-slug` is the path where you want your slides to show up, for eg. `https://slides.shetty.me/chrome-ai-apis/` here `chrome-ai-apis` is the `path-slug`

Remember the `path-slug` which you used, you will need it later.

The static files will be stored in the `dist/` folder.

## Sending the static files to your server

This step is only needed if you are building the static assets on your personal device.

If you are building your slides on your server you can skip this step, ie by either cloning from GitHub and generating static files

We are using [rsync](https://x.com/ShettyDeveesh/status/1965751860238668130#m) to send the files

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`rsync -avz --delete dist/ <user>@<server-ip>:/var/www/<subdomain-name>/<path-slug>/`}
/>

We are copying it to `var/www/` since that's where nginx hosts the static files.

If you are hosting it directly in your domain then you can exclude the `<subdomain-name>` in the path.

Note: `<subdomain-name>` is `slides` whereas `<subdomain>` is `slides.example.com` ie the full hostname

## Setting up reverse proxy to your subdomain

If you have already configured the subdomain in nginx config, you can skip this step

Create a new file in `etc/nginx/sites-available/<subdomain-name>`

Add this configuration inside it

<CodeBlock
  language="nginx"
  code={`server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <subdomain>;

    root /var/www/<subdomain-name>;
    index index.html;

    # Serve each deck's own index.html when deep-linked
    location ~ ^/([^/]+)/ {
      root /var/www/<subdomain-name>;
      try_files $uri $uri/ /$1/index.html;
    }

}`}
/>

The above regex is used to match the URL params and match it with the nested files, otherwise page reload will fallback to `/`

You can generate SSL certificates using [cert-bot](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=pip) so your slides will be accessible over `https`.

Make sure you have the DNS configured for your subdomain in your domain registrar.

Now you need to enable this subdomain by [soft linking](https://x.com/ShettyDeveesh/status/1965485368628670637#m) the file

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<subdomain> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`}
/>

## Final touches

If you followed till without error you should be golden, to make sure nginx serves the recently updated content:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx`}
/>

Now if you visit your `<subdomain>/<path-slug>`, you can see the slides. 🎉

Additionaly, I have added an `index.html` to the root of the folder at [`/var/www/<subdomain-name>`](https://slides.shetty.me) where I link all the slides I have hosted.

Awesome, thanks for reading till the end, hope this brings new level to your presentations.

## Some helpful notes

<details>
  <summary>I don't have an VPS, can i still host?</summary>
  Yes, you can throw those static files to any provider like netlify or vercel, it should work perfectly fine.

Just that it hides all the complexity we just went through above :)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>If you face permission error while transferring file to your server</summary>

Most likely the case can be because you cant directly write to `/var/www` without `sudo`

As workaround for this, you can copy the files to some temporary folder then move it to `/var/www` by ssh'ing into your vps and using `sudo` to move.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>If you face error while reloading nginx</summary>

It can happen because of any misconfigurations in your file, make sure you followed the commands above correctly, if the issue still persists, you can run it through you favourite LLM :)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>If you face 403 error on opening your site</summary>

It might be because nginx doesnt have permissions to read your files, you can either transfer ownership or give explicit permissions

This solved the issue for me

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/<subdomain-name>`}
/>

Alternatively,

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`sudo chmod -R o+r /var/www/slides
chmod -R o+X /var/www/slides`}
/>
