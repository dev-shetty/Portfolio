You may have only used `console.log()` in JavaScript, but you can do many more things with the **console** object.

## 1. console.table()

If you have an object and want a clear view of it instead of having those ugly braces in the console you can use `console.table()`

<CodeBlock
  language="javascript"
  code={`const obj = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York",
  country: "USA",
};
console.table(obj);`}
/>

## 2. console.error()

You will get a cool-looking (yeah ðŸ™‚) red color message for the instances where you want to make the stress on the bug more realistic.

<CodeBlock
  language="javascript"
  code={`console.error("Why is this rendering twice");`}
/>

## 3. console.warn()

Similar to error but a little less stressful, you can mostly use this as a warning to yourself.

<CodeBlock
  language="javascript"
  code={`console.warn("Fix this in the next release!");`}
/>

## 4. console.time()

You can get the computation time easily by using `console.time()`, which starts the timer, and `console.timeEnd()` which ends it to compute the time taken by your code.
You can pass a label inside the `time()` function which makes the timer unique, so you can have as many number of timers in your program.

<CodeBlock
  language="javascript"
  code={`console.time("Time");
let count = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  count += 1;
}
console.timeEnd("Time");`}
/>

That's it for this blog... There are many more methods available, if you are interested you can check it out at [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console).
