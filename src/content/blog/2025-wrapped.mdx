Wrapping 2025 with some moments that stood out, and a few reflections.

- Joining [Levels.fyi](http://Levels.fyi) full time, and building interactive offers end-to-end from the initial `index.tsx` to implementing feedbacks from paying customers
- Taking my family on our first international trip to Malaysia, even before graduating from college.
- Graduating as a Computer Science Engineer with a 9.54 CGPA
- Getting a rejection from GSoC, where they had to choose between 2 candidates, but the process taught me a lot of things.
- Growing DK24 which we started a year back, now gaining great momentum from communities and industries in shaping the tech ecosystem.
- Becoming an Associate Member at TiE, and contributing to the FOSS community by volunteering IndiaFOSS and organizing MangaloreFOSS, the largest open-source conference in Mangalore.
- One of the notable open-source contributions, shipping a feature to AstroJS, merged and available since Astro 5.15.
- Giving a bunch of talks, notably one at GDG Devfest Mangalore, mentoring and evaluating hackathons and projects.
- Closing the year having read 23 books, a 3x improvement from 2024, and also being consistent in going to the gym.
- Have been a little sporadic in writing technical articles and blogs, definitely a key focus area for 2026.
- Another focus for 2026 will be broadening my understanding across different CS domains, and building foundations in them.

Ending the year being grateful to God, all the people who guided me in this journey, the ones I met throughout the year, and all the little things that added up.

Hoping for an exciting year ahead.
